\chapter*{Preface}
\label{chap:preface}

This book is designed for aspiring and experienced competitive programmers who wish to master advanced computational geometry. It covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental primitives to sophisticated algorithms and optimization techniques, all with a focus on practical implementation and robust solutions crucial for programming contests.

We aim to provide clear theoretical explanations, illustrative examples, canonical algorithm structures, discussions on precision and common pitfalls, relevant problem patterns, and template-quality C++17 code snippets.
