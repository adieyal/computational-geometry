When your convex hull algorithm isn't working correctly, check these common issues:
\begin{debugchecklist}[Convex Hull Algorithms]
\item \textbf{Orientation test}: Verify your cross product calculation is correct and handles numerical precision issues.
\item \textbf{Sorting}: For Graham Scan, check if points are sorted correctly by polar angle.
\item \textbf{Initial point selection}: Verify that your algorithm correctly identifies the point to start from (lowest y-coordinate for Graham Scan).
\item \textbf{Collinear points}: Test your algorithm on sets of three or more collinear points.
\item \textbf{Edge cases}: Test with inputs of size 0, 1, 2, and 3.
\item \textbf{Stack operations}: For stack-based algorithms, ensure push/pop operations maintain the correct hull.
\item \textbf{Visualization}: Draw the intermediate steps to identify where your algorithm deviates from the expected behavior.
\item \textbf{Orientation consistency}: Make sure you're consistently checking for clockwise or counterclockwise orientation throughout your code.
\item \textbf{Degeneracy handling}: Check that your code correctly handles degenerate cases like all points being collinear.
