\caption{Monotone Chain (Andrew's Algorithm)}
\KwIn{A set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane}
\KwOut{The convex hull of $P$ as a sequence of vertices in counterclockwise order}

Sort points by $x$-coordinate (breaking ties by $y$-coordinate)\;
Initialize empty lower and upper hulls\;

\textbf{Build lower hull:}\\
\For{each point $p$ from left to right}{
    \While{lower hull contains at least 2 points AND the last 3 points don't make a left turn}{
        Remove the middle of the last 3 points from the lower hull\;
    }
    Add $p$ to the lower hull\;
}

\textbf{Build upper hull:}\\
\For{each point $p$ from right to left}{
    \While{upper hull contains at least 2 points AND the last 3 points don't make a left turn}{
        Remove the middle of the last 3 points from the upper hull\;
    }
    Add $p$ to the upper hull\;
}

Remove the duplicate endpoints from both hulls\;
\Return{concatenated lower and upper hulls}\;
