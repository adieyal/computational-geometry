\part{Foundations \& Primitives}
\label{part:I}

% This part introduces the fundamental geometric objects, operations,
% and numerical considerations crucial for computational geometry.
% We start with basic definitions and build up to essential predicates
% like orientation and segment intersection, which form the bedrock
% of more complex algorithms discussed in later parts.
% Emphasis is placed on robust implementation, particularly handling
% floating-point precision and integer overflow, common pitfalls in
% competitive programming.

% If Part I had more chapters, they would be \input here
% e.g., \input{ch_B/ch_B_master} for a chapter on Polygons or Triangulations
