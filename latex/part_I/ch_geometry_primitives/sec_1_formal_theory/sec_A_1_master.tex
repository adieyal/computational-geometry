\section{Formal Theory: The Language of Shapes}
\label{sec:A.1}

Welcome to the mathematical heart of our geometric toolkit! Before we can write clever algorithms, we need a precise language to talk about shapes and their properties. This section introduces the fundamental "nouns" and "verbs" of 2D computational geometry: points, vectors, lines, and the basic operations that connect them. Don't worry, we'll keep the theory grounded and always link it back to how you'll actually use these concepts in code. Think of this as learning the alphabet before writing poetry.
