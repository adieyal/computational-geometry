\begin{problemexample}[Problem: "Points and Lines" - Codeforces Gym 100187B]
\label{probex:A.4.1}
\textit{Why}: Direct application of orientation/distance.
% Brief description of the problem and how it uses the concepts...
This problem typically involves determining relationships between given points and lines, such as checking if a point lies on a line, to which side of a line a point lies, or calculating distances. These are direct applications of dot/cross products for orientation and point-line distance formulas.
