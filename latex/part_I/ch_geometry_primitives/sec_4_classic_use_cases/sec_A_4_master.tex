\section{Classic Use-Cases \& Problem Patterns}
\label{sec:A.4}

Okay, theory is great, algorithms are neat, but where does the rubber meet the road? This section is all about seeing our geometric primitives in action! We'll explore common problem patterns that appear in contests and how the tools from \Cref{sec:A.1} and \Cref{sec:A.2} are applied to solve them. Recognizing these patterns is a huge step towards becoming a geometry whiz. Each subsection will often be framed around a typical problem type.
