\section{Canonical Algorithms: The Recipes}
\label{sec:A.2}

Now that we've defined our geometric ingredients (\Cref{sec:A.1}), let's look at some standard recipes for combining them. This section provides pseudocode for the most common geometric primitive operations you'll use repeatedly. We'll focus on the logic here; C++ implementations will come later (\Cref{sec:A.5}) or as part of specific examples.
