\label{roadmap:geometry_primitives}
% TikZ diagram description:
% The roadmap starts with "Points & Vectors" and "Lines, Segments, Rays". "Points & Vectors" leads to "Dot & Cross Products".
% "Dot & Cross Products" is a key tool for "Orientation Test (CCW)" and is used in "Distance Calculations".
% "Lines, Segments, Rays" and "Dot & Cross Products" feed into "Distance Calculations".
% "Orientation Test (CCW)" is the basis for "Segment Intersection". "Distance Calculations" can be a component of segment intersection (e.g. for collinear checks).
% "Orientation Test" and "Segment Intersection" are applied in "Basic Geometric Queries", "Angular Sort", and "Path Self-Intersection".
% All foundational concepts ("Points & Vectors", "Lines, Segments, Rays", "Dot & Cross Products", "Distance Calculations", "Orientation Test", "Segment Intersection") are affected by "Numerical Precision".
% "Template Code" provides implementations for many of these primitives.
% The flow shows dependencies: e.g., understanding points/vectors is needed for dot/cross products, which are needed for orientation, which is needed for segment intersection. Applications branch off from these core concepts.
