\section{Template-Quality Code Snippets}
\label{sec:A.5}

Talk is cheap, show me the code! This section provides well-commented, reusable C++ code snippets for the fundamental geometric structures and operations discussed in this chapter. These are designed to be copy-paste-adapt friendly for your contest template. We'll prioritize clarity, correctness (especially with integer types), and typical competitive programming style.
