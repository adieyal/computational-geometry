\section{Lesser-Known Tricks \& Advanced Tidbits}
\label{sec:A.7}

Beyond the standard textbook material, there are always interesting nuances, clever optimizations, or more robust ways to handle tricky situations in computational geometry. This section briefly touches on a couple of such areas related to our foundational topics. These might not be "open research" in the academic sense, but they represent deeper dives or alternative perspectives.
