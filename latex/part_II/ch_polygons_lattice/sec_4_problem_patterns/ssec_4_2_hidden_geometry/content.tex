\subsection{Hidden Geometry}

\begin{pattern}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Recognition:} Problem about grids/lattices that doesn't mention geometry
        \item \textbf{Approach:} Model as polygons, apply Pick's theorem
        \item \textbf{Common Variations:} Counting valid positions, grid path problems
    \end{itemize}
