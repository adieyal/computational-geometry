\subsection{Lattice Points and Pick's Theorem}
\label{ssec:lattice_points_picks}

\begin{definition}[Lattice Point]
A point $(x,y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are integers. On a grid, these are the intersection points.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Pick's Theorem]
For a simple polygon with integer vertices:
$$\text{Area} = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1$$
where $I$ = interior lattice points, $B$ = boundary lattice points.
\end{theorem}
